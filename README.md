I am a Computer Science undergraduate at COCSIT, Latur, with a strong interest in building reliable and well-structured software systems. My work focuses on full-stack development, automation tools, and database-driven applications, with an emphasis on clarity, maintainability, and real-world use cases.

I actively use GitHub to design, document, and refine projects that apply core computer science concepts through practical implementation.

## Selected Projects
- **PDF Merger Tool** — A Python-based desktop application with a graphical interface for merging and managing PDF files efficiently.
- **Image Scraper** — A Python web scraping tool designed to extract and download images based on user-defined input, demonstrating data extraction and automation workflows.
- **Library Management System** — A Java-based web application built using JSP, Servlets, and MySQL, implementing MVC architecture for managing library operations.
